<h2>About</h2>

This page demonstrates a native OpenLCB control panel running in a HTML5 web
browser. The panel was drawn in JMRI and then automatically converted using a
program to a HTML page that you see. The program understands many of the
concepts in the XML file written by JMRI and represents the same concept using
a native OpenLCB program running right inside your browser. There is no need
for a running JMRI machine in order to operate this page -- it can run in your
web browser, on your smart phone or on a tablet and control the layout
directly. <br/>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>

There is an OpenLCB bus, connected to the layout. On this bus there is a node
that acts as a gateway. The gateway is connected to Ethernet or wifi, and acts
as a webserver, serving the panel.html and the included javascript code that
you are using. This gateway also contains a websocket server. A Raspberry Pi or
a Beaglebone Black is perfectly capable of performing this gateway
function.<br/>

When you load the panel.html page, it contains the graphic elements, a
reference to the OpenLCB code, and a number of bindings between the two. The
OpenLCB code is compiled into JavaScript, connects using the websockets
protocol to the gateway and participates in the OpenLCB bus as a fully
functional node. </br>

<h2>Modifications for this demo</h2>

This demo is completely virtual. The OpenLCB bus is only represented as a
TCP/IP hub running as a computer program. There is another node running as a
computer program connected to it, which runs the signaling logic. This
signaling logic is exactly the same as the one running inside the real layout
(although in the real layout it is running in a physical node, mounted below
the benchwork).<br/>

Of course if you connected the real layout using a CAN-USB adapter, then all
the turnout throws, occupancy sensors etc would be operating as usual.
